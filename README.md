# ScrumMap
Your own motivation tool :)

## Hi! Firstly thank you for visiting page of source code of my app. 
I know that in large companies workers need to mark their duties using some kind of Scrum maps, so i decided to create something like that using Java EE & some Front-End technologies for common people.

### Logging page.

### Main page. 
Here you can create your duties or delete them, also you can sort them by status or get duty details.
